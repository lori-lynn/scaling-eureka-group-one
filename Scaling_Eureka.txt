Scaling Eureka


Around here, most people just call it, The Mountain. A truly massive hunk of rock and ice, she looms over our village with a constant presence that inspires both awe and fear among the people of our tribe. She is the most prominent and formidable feature on the horizon for miles around. While she is still an active volcano, descriptions of the last eruption are nothing more than legend passed down through many generations. Almost daily, thunderous noises can be heard from her highest reaches as glaciers break apart, and boulders are sent careening down her slopes. Fierce shaking and trembling can often be felt from the tumult and chaos still present in her core. Indeed, our people know of no greater force in this world, and as such, The Mountain garners great respect and reverence.


According to our elders, Mount Eureka, as she is more formally known, is best enjoyed from afar. They say there are mysterious and dangerous creatures who dwell upon her ridges. And worse than that, they warn, those who have dared an attempt at her peak were dispatched as effortlessly as a man discards a mosquito. Not one adventurer has returned to tell their tale. Despite this knowledge, I have long been obsessed with discovering Eureka for myself. In fact, I plan to embark on my journey to the summit in three days time. But first, there are preparations to be made, and people to consult. So it begins.

Light streamed in through the fog, causing the air to eerily glow, and the ice beneath our feet to shimmer. I felt blinded by her beauty. 


"How much time has passed since we left?" We had only just left, but Sophie already seemed exhausted from the initial hike. Her heaving broke the silence. We stopped for a moment so she could plant herself on a rock and rest.


"An hour."


"Can we go back now?" Watching the girl awkwardly yank off her backpack, I realized she was geniunely trying to take a break. Annoyed, I sat where I stood. 


"No." Impatiently, I motioned for her to speed up, but she ignored it. Her fingers stiffened so much from the cool winter air that even trying to uncap her water bottle appeared comical. "Why'd you come if you were just going to slow me down?"


"Gotta bring you back home safe, stupid."


"We're gonna die on this mountain at the rate you walk," I scoffed. "We haven't even moved more than 3 kilometers."


"Shut your whining face."


After a few minutes had passed, we began to march again. Sophie hummed some nonsensical song as she bounced forward.
